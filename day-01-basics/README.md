Day 01 – JavaScript Basics

What I practiced today:
- Variables using let, const, and var
- Basic data types and typeof
- Writing and calling functions
- Array operations like push, unshift, pop, splice, and filter
- Creating and updating objects
- Using methods and the this keyword

Files in this folder:
- index.js → variables, data types, functions, arrays
- objects.js → object creation and methods

Key takeaways:
- Arrays can be modified or copied depending on the method used
- Objects help group related data and behavior
- this refers to the current object inside a method
