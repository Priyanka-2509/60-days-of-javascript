Day 11 – Objects (Advanced)

What I practiced:
- Creating objects with properties and methods
- Accessing, adding, updating, and deleting properties
- Working with nested objects
- Looping through object keys
- Object destructuring
- Copying objects using spread operator

Real-life use:
Objects are used to represent users, products,
API responses, and application state.
