Day 08 – Date & Math Objects

What I practiced:
- Creating and using the Date object
- Extracting year, month, date, and time values
- Basic date calculations like age
- Math methods such as round, floor, ceil
- Generating random numbers

Real-life use:
Date and Math objects are used in timers, games,
calculations, and handling time-based logic in applications.
