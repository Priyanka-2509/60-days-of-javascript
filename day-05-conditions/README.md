Day 05 – Operators & Conditional Logic

What I practiced:
- Comparison operators (>, <, ===, !==)
- Logical operators (&&, ||, !)
- if / else and else-if conditions
- Writing a grading program
- Using ternary operator for short conditions

Real-life use:
Conditional logic is used in authentication,
permissions, validation, and decision making in apps.
