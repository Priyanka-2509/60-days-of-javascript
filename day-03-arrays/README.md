Day 03 – Arrays (map, filter, reduce)

What I practiced:
- map to transform array values
- filter to select elements based on conditions
- reduce to combine array values into a single result
- chaining array methods for step-by-step data processing

Key takeaways:
- map, filter, and reduce do not modify the original array
- reduce uses an accumulator to build a final result
- chaining makes code cleaner and easier to read

Real-life use:
These methods are commonly used to process API data,
filter product lists, and calculate totals in applications.
