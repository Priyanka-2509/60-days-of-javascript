Day 09 – Scope & Hoisting

What I practiced:
- Global, function, and block scope
- Difference between var, let, and const
- Variable hoisting behavior
- Function hoisting vs function expressions

Key takeaways:
- var ignores block scope
- let and const are block scoped
- var is hoisted as undefined
- let and const cannot be used before declaration
