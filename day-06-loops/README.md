Day 06 – Loops

What I practiced:
- for loop for fixed repetitions
- while loop for condition-based repetition
- do...while loop to execute code at least once
- looping through arrays and strings

Real-life use:
Loops are used to process lists, repeat tasks,
and handle multiple values efficiently in applications.
