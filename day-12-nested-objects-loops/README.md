Day 12 – Nested Objects & Loops

What I practiced:
- Working with nested objects
- Accessing object properties inside objects
- Looping through arrays inside objects
- Looping through object keys using for...in
- Iterating over an array of objects

Real-life use:
Nested objects and loops are commonly used
to process API data and display lists in applications.
